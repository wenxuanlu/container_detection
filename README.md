# ObjectDetection_program
whu cs 2023 summer semester project
1.  We have developed a simple systems for detecting the number of port containers and verification code using YOLOv6
2. this is only final work for summer training in school of computer Wuhan University, and it is not used for any business situation
3. the frame YOLOv6 is forked from meituan, and the dataset I used is provided by wuhan fannuo software conpany. Please send me an email to get the dataset if you are interested.

Solved：

The results are displayed repeatedly overlaid when the detection button is clicked.

The original image shows up again when the detection button is clicked.

The detected container numbers are displayed in the wrong sequence. Reason: the clustering algorithm's clustering criterion has been changed to the vertical coordinate."
